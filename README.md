# calculator app

This is a basic calculator app, built from scratch, that performs the basic functions of a calculator. I am expecting to update this in this future to include the advanced functions of a calculator (think of the extra options that appear when you turn your calculator app to landscape view).

Created using Sass, JavaScript, and jQuery.
